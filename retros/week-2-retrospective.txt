(11/30) Local Music Retrospective:
	- What went well?
		○ Did better on time management, got a demo-able material ready by Wednesday, added test cases, and were able to safely merge again Friday with more changes without it being extremely conflicting.  
	- What's not going well?
		○ Project scope is a little bit larger than we expected, we thought doing things like editing account information would take less time than they did. We had to push back some of our expectations for this milestone to the next milestone in order to have functioning features. 
	- How to improve:
Taking a moment to reevaluate our point assignments, and potentially break down our large tasks into smaller tasks that are easier to manage for each developer.
